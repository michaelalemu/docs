## Getting Started with FXEthio API

To get started using FXEthio’s API, follow these simple steps:

<Steps>
  <Step icon="user" title="1. Create an Account">
    To begin, you’ll need to create an account with FXEthio. Head over to our [sign-up page](https://fxethio.com/pricing), choose a plan and fill in the necessary details to register.
  </Step>

  <Step icon="key" title="2. Create an API Key">
    After signing up, log in to your dashboard and generate an API key. This key will give you access to FXEthio’s foreign exchange rate data. Go to the API section in your dashboard to create your key.

    <Note>
      Make sure to save your API key, as it will not be shown again once you navigate away from this page.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step icon="plug" title="3. Use the API Key">
    To make authenticated requests to FXEthio’s API, include the API key in the `x-api-header` of your HTTP requests.

    Example:

    ```bash
    curl -X GET "https://fxethio.com/api/v1/[endpoint]" \
    -H "x-api-key: [your-api-key-here]"
    ```

    This key will authenticate each of your requests to access live exchange rate data from Ethiopian banks against major currencies.
  </Step>
